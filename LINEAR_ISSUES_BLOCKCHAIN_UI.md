## Implementation Notes

### Design System Recommendations:
1. Create shared Tailwind utilities for glassmorphism effects
2. Define gradient presets in `tailwind.config.js`
3. Use Framer Motion for consistent animations
4. Create reusable glass card components
5. Document neon color palette in design system

### Technical Considerations:
- Ensure performance with backdrop-blur (can be GPU intensive)
- Test on various devices and browsers
- Maintain accessibility (contrast ratios, focus states)
- Consider reduced motion preferences
- Optimize gradient rendering

### Color Palette Reference:
- **Backgrounds:** slate-900, slate-950, black
- **Glass:** white/5, white/10 with backdrop-blur-xl
- **Gradients:** indigo-600, cyan-500, purple-600, pink-600
- **Accents:** cyan-400, purple-400, pink-400
- **Text:** white, slate-100, slate-200
- **Borders:** white/10, white/20

### Animation Guidelines:
- Use easing functions: `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`
- Duration: 200-300ms for micro-interactions
- Hover states: scale 1.02-1.05, glow effects
- Page transitions: 400-500ms
- Consider `prefers-reduced-motion`
